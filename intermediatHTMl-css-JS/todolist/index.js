// list of projects, every project will have different todos
//         there should be a default project, you can either make one not deleteable or 
//         you can make a function if there is no projects than 1 then we will be able to delete that.

// what you can do is to have different arrays for different projects. by clicking the project we will map
// inside the arrays or object and printout every data from it to the home screan


// what we need now? we need a div on the left to show the current projects, also a button to make new projects
// a home screen will be on the left, by clicking, it should display the project todos and then we will be able
// to add new todos to that project as well.


// we need a class for creating projects or to do list, i think the todo should be the main class
// the project will be the child class. 
// we need a static button to create for each project and todos
